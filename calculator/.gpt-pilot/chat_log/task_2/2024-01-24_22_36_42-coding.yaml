  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "You are working on a App called \"calculator\" and you need to write code for the entire application.\n\nHere\
    \ is a high level description of \"calculator\":\n```\ncreate a calculator that can do main 4 math functions\n```\n\n\
    Here are the technologies that you need to use for this project:\n```\n- Node.js\n- Express\n- Bootstrap\n- HTML\n- CSS3\n\
    - jQuery\n```\n\n\nDevelopment process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:\n```\n\
    1. Initialize a Node.js project with Express framework and set up an Express server to run on a pre-specified port. Include\
    \ a basic root route that sends a response indicating the server is live.\n\n2. Implement the front end using Bootstrap,\
    \ HTML, and CSS3 to create an interface for the calculator with buttons for digits 0-9, operators for addition, subtraction,\
    \ multiplication, and division, and an equals button for computing the result.\n\n3. Create jQuery scripts enabling the\
    \ calculator's buttons to update a display field on the user interface with the user's input, including numbers and selected\
    \ operations.\n\n4. Develop the logic for the calculator's backend in Node.js to handle HTTP POST requests with calculations\
    \ to perform and return the result.\n\n5. Integrate the frontend with the backend such that clicking the equals button\
    \ on the UI sends a request to the backend, calculates the result, and displays the result on the UI.\n\n```\nYou are\
    \ currently working on task \"Implement the front end using Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS3 to create an interface for the calculator\
    \ with buttons for digits 0-9, operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and an equals button\
    \ for computing the result.\" and you have to focus only on that task.\n\n\nA part of the app is already finished.Here\

    \ info. Here it is:\n```\nreverses the position of buttons c and =\n```\n\nCan you debug this issue or implement changes\
    \ to comply with the additional user input?\n\nTell me all the new code that needs to be written or modified to implement\
    \ current task and have it fully working. You can count that the environment is set up previously and packages listed\
    \ in files are installed so tell me only commands needed for installation of new dependencies, if there are any.\n\n\n\
    **IMPORTANT**\nWhen you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible\
    \ and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file. Whenever a file becomes too large (more than 50 lines\
    \ of code) split it into smaller files.\n\n\nYou do not need to make any automated tests work.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nDo not\
    \ tell me anything about setting up the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed."

  content: "To comply with the request to reverse the positions of the \"C\" (clear) button and the \"=\" (equals) button,\
    \ you will need to modify the HTML structure in `public/index.html`. \n\nHere is what you have to do to the `public/index.html`\
    \ file:\n\n```html\n        <!-- ... other rows omitted for brevity ... -->\n        <div class=\"calculator-row\">\n\
    \          <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-info btn-block\" value=\"0\">0</button>\n          <!-- Swap the position\
    \ of \"C\" button and \"=\" button -->\n          <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-info\" value=\"=\">=</button>\n\
    \          <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-danger\" value=\"C\">C</button>\n          <button type=\"button\"\
    \ class=\"btn btn-warning\" value=\"/\">&divide;</button>\n        </div>\n        <!-- ... other parts of index.html\
    \ omitted for brevity ... -->\n```\n\nThis edit reverses the buttons \"C\" and \"=\" so that the \"=\" button now comes\
    \ before the \"C\" button on the calculator's interface. The CSS applied to these buttons will still work as expected,\
    \ meaning no changes are needed to `public/styles.css`.\n\nAfter making the change, confirm that the layout still looks\
    \ as expected and the buttons still function correctly when clicked. In the context of the given tasks, no further code\
    \ changes are required based on the current task description and feedback. Once you've confirmed everything is working\
    \ as intended, the task can be marked as done.\n\nThere are no new dependencies needed for this change, and there are\
    \ no additional scripts or styles to be added, so no installation steps are required. All modifications are within the\
    \ existing HTML file, which should keep the line count well below the 50-line threshold for splitting into multiple files."

    Do not reply with anything else but the command with which I can run this app with.
