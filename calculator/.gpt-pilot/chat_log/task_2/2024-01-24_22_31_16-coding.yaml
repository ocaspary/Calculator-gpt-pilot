  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "You are working on a App called \"calculator\" and you need to write code for the entire application.\n\nHere\
    \ is a high level description of \"calculator\":\n```\ncreate a calculator that can do main 4 math functions\n```\n\n\
    Here are the technologies that you need to use for this project:\n```\n- Node.js\n- Express\n- Bootstrap\n- HTML\n- CSS3\n\
    - jQuery\n```\n\n\nDevelopment process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:\n```\n\
    1. Initialize a Node.js project with Express framework and set up an Express server to run on a pre-specified port. Include\
    \ a basic root route that sends a response indicating the server is live.\n\n2. Implement the front end using Bootstrap,\
    \ HTML, and CSS3 to create an interface for the calculator with buttons for digits 0-9, operators for addition, subtraction,\
    \ multiplication, and division, and an equals button for computing the result.\n\n3. Create jQuery scripts enabling the\
    \ calculator's buttons to update a display field on the user interface with the user's input, including numbers and selected\
    \ operations.\n\n4. Develop the logic for the calculator's backend in Node.js to handle HTTP POST requests with calculations\
    \ to perform and return the result.\n\n5. Integrate the frontend with the backend such that clicking the equals button\
    \ on the UI sends a request to the backend, calculates the result, and displays the result on the UI.\n\n```\nYou are\
    \ currently working on task \"Implement the front end using Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS3 to create an interface for the calculator\
    \ with buttons for digits 0-9, operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and an equals button\
    \ for computing the result.\" and you have to focus only on that task.\n\n\nA part of the app is already finished.Here\

    \ sent you some additional info. Here it is:\n```\nthe digits must be on 3 lines: first line high : 7 8 9, second line\
    \ middle : 4 5 6,third line at the bottom : 1 2 3, the result must appear after click on equal sign\n```\n\nCan you debug\
    \ this issue or implement changes to comply with the additional user input?\n\nTell me all the new code that needs to\
    \ be written or modified to implement current task and have it fully working. You can count that the environment is set\
    \ up previously and packages listed in files are installed so tell me only commands needed for installation of new dependencies,\
    \ if there are any.\n\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nWhen you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make\
    \ files as small as possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file. Whenever a file becomes too\
    \ large (more than 50 lines of code) split it into smaller files.\n\n\nYou do not need to make any automated tests work.\n\
    \n**IMPORTANT**\nDo not tell me anything about setting up the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies\
    \ need to be installed."

  content: "From the task instructions and the additional input from your colleague, it seems we need to rearrange the number\
    \ buttons to match the requested order and ensure the result is displayed when the equal sign is clicked. Here are the\
    \ changes needed in your codebase:\n\n1. Update the `index.html` file to reorder the buttons as required:\n\nInside `public/index.html`,\
    \ rearrange the HTML for the calculator number keys to match the given order:\n\n```html\n<!-- ...existing code... -->\n\

    \ only on the front end and handling of the equals button is tasked for future implementation (Task #4 and #5), we do\
    \ not need to modify the `script.js` now.\n\n3. There's no need for additional dependencies since we're only modifying\
    \ the existing front-end code.\n\nThese changes should fulfill the requirements for the front-end task. Note that the\
    \ backend part of the code for evaluating the expressions entered in the calculator has not been implemented yet. Your\
    \ current work only affects the display/input layer of the calculator app. \n\nAfter making these changes, review the\
    \ HTML and ensure the layout looks as expected in the browser. If everything is displayed correctly and the buttons are\
    \ in the correct order, the task can be marked as complete from a programmatic goal perspective. The user-review goal\
    \ will be met when a human (like your colleague who is testing the app) reviews it and confirms it meets their expectations\
    \ regarding functionality and layout."
