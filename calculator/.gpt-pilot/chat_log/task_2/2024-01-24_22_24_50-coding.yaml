  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "You are working on a App called \"calculator\" and you need to write code for the entire application.\n\nHere\
    \ is a high level description of \"calculator\":\n```\ncreate a calculator that can do main 4 math functions\n```\n\n\
    Here are the technologies that you need to use for this project:\n```\n- Node.js\n- Express\n- Bootstrap\n- HTML\n- CSS3\n\
    - jQuery\n```\n\n\nDevelopment process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:\n```\n\
    1. Initialize a Node.js project with Express framework and set up an Express server to run on a pre-specified port. Include\
    \ a basic root route that sends a response indicating the server is live.\n\n2. Implement the front end using Bootstrap,\
    \ HTML, and CSS3 to create an interface for the calculator with buttons for digits 0-9, operators for addition, subtraction,\
    \ multiplication, and division, and an equals button for computing the result.\n\n3. Create jQuery scripts enabling the\
    \ calculator's buttons to update a display field on the user interface with the user's input, including numbers and selected\
    \ operations.\n\n4. Develop the logic for the calculator's backend in Node.js to handle HTTP POST requests with calculations\
    \ to perform and return the result.\n\n5. Integrate the frontend with the backend such that clicking the equals button\
    \ on the UI sends a request to the backend, calculates the result, and displays the result on the UI.\n\n```\nYou are\
    \ currently working on task \"Implement the front end using Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS3 to create an interface for the calculator\
    \ with buttons for digits 0-9, operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and an equals button\
    \ for computing the result.\" and you have to focus only on that task.\n\n\nA part of the app is already finished.Here\

    \ or implement changes to comply with the additional user input?\n\nTell me all the new code that needs to be written\
    \ or modified to implement current task and have it fully working. You can count that the environment is set up previously\
    \ and packages listed in files are installed so tell me only commands needed for installation of new dependencies, if\
    \ there are any.\n\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nWhen you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make\
    \ files as small as possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file. Whenever a file becomes too\
    \ large (more than 50 lines of code) split it into smaller files.\n\n\nYou do not need to make any automated tests work.\n\
    \n**IMPORTANT**\nDo not tell me anything about setting up the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies\
    \ need to be installed."
- role: assistant
  content: "From the description and the colleague's feedback, it appears the issue might be with the organization and functionality\
    \ of the buttons representing digits 0-9 and the display of calculation results. To address this, we need to review the\
    \ HTML structure and styles to ensure that the buttons are arranged correctly and that the display field is appropriately\
    \ showing the entered digits and the calculated result.\n\nBased on the feedback, I will implement the following changes:\n\
    \n### 1. `public/index.html` Modifications:\nTo arrange the digit buttons in a typical calculator layout with the '0'\
    \ button spanning a wider area, the following HTML code will be modified:\n\n```html\n<!-- ... rest of the HTML ... -->\n\
    \n<!-- Add a new row for the digit '0' and clear button -->\n<div class=\"calculator-row\">\n  <button type=\"button\"\
    \ class=\"btn btn-info btn-block\" value=\"0\">0</button>\n  <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-danger\" value=\"\
    C\">C</button>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"calculator-row\">\n  <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-info\" value=\"1\"\
    >1</button>\n  <!-- ... other buttons ... -->\n</div>\n\n<!-- ... rest of the HTML ... -->\n```\n\n### 2. Modify `public/styles.css`\
    \ to Define `.calculator-row` and Update Button Width\nEnsure that the '0' button has a different width to span two columns.\n\
    \n```css\n/* Add a new rule for calculator rows */\n.calculator-row {\n  display: flex;\n}\n\n/* Update calculator-keys\
    \ button margin */\n.calculator-keys button {\n  flex: 1; /* Allow buttons to grow and take up equal space */\n  margin:\
    \ 2px; /* Decrease margin to accommodate flex spacing */\n}\n\n/* Add specific style for the '0' and clear button to span\
    \ two columns */\n.btn-block {\n  flex: 2; /* Make '0' button twice as large as other buttons */\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update\
    \ `public/script.js` (no actual change, but noting the scope for future tasks)\nCurrently, the script handles the digit\
    \ and operation button clicks but does not calculate the result which will be addressed in Tasks #4 and #5. So, no changes\
    \ are needed here at this moment, based on the current task.\n\n### No New Dependencies\nThere are no new dependencies\
    \ to install for these changes.\n\n### File Organization Note\nThe project files continue to remain small and modular\
    \ with each file focused on a specific aspect of the application (index.js for server setup, HTML for markup, CSS for\
    \ styles, and JS for interactivity). None of the files have exceeded the 50 lines maximum threshold indicated for splitting\
    \ into smaller files.\n\nBy applying these changes, the task assigned (\"Implementation of the front-end interface for\
    \ the calculator\") will be further aligned to both the provided description and the user review goal. The interface will\
    \ have a typical calculator layout, and the display field will be formatted to be ready for showing the user's input and\
    \ the computed result as per the subsequent tasks."

    \nEach step can be either:\n\n* `command` - command to run (must be able to run on a Windows machine, assume current working\

    \ file is smaller than 20 lines or if many lines need to be changed\n* `modify_file` - update ONE existing file; use this\
    \ if the existing file is larger than 20 lines and only a few lines need to be updated\n\nIf the step is of type `save_file`\
