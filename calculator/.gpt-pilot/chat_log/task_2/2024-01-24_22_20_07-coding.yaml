  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "You are working on a App called \"calculator\" and you need to write code for the entire app based on the tasks\
    \ that the tech lead gives you. So that you understand better what you're working on, you're given other specs for \"\
    calculator\" as well.\n\nHere is a high level description of \"calculator\":\n```\ncreate a calculator that can do main\
    \ 4 math functions\n```\n\n\nHere are the technologies that you need to use for this project:\n```\n\n- Node.js\n\n- Express\n\
    \n- Bootstrap\n\n- HTML\n\n- CSS3\n\n- jQuery\n\n```\n\n\n\n\nSo far, this code has been implemented:\n\n**/package.json**\n\
    ```\n{\n  \"name\": \"calculator\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n\
    \  \"directories\": {\n    \"test\": \"tests\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\
    \" && exit 1\"\n  },\n  \"keywords\": [],\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"license\": \"ISC\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"\
    express\": \"^4.18.2\"\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n\n**/index.js**\n```\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n\
    const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000; // Choose a port to listen on, ensure it's not port 5000\n\napp.get('/', (req,\
    \ res) => {\n  res.send('Calculator App server is operational');\n});\n\napp.listen(PORT, () => {\n  console.log(`Server\
    \ running on port ${PORT}`);\n});\n```\n\n\n\n\nWe've broken the development of this app down to these tasks:\n```\n1.\
    \ Initialize a Node.js project with Express framework and set up an Express server to run on a pre-specified port. Include\
    \ a basic root route that sends a response indicating the server is live.\n\n2. Implement the front end using Bootstrap,\
    \ HTML, and CSS3 to create an interface for the calculator with buttons for digits 0-9, operators for addition, subtraction,\
    \ multiplication, and division, and an equals button for computing the result.\n\n3. Create jQuery scripts enabling the\
    \ calculator's buttons to update a display field on the user interface with the user's input, including numbers and selected\
    \ operations.\n\n4. Develop the logic for the calculator's backend in Node.js to handle HTTP POST requests with calculations\
    \ to perform and return the result.\n\n5. Integrate the frontend with the backend such that clicking the equals button\
    \ on the UI sends a request to the backend, calculates the result, and displays the result on the UI.\n\n```\n\nYou are\
    \ currently working on task #2 with the following description:\n```\nImplement the front end using Bootstrap, HTML, and\
    \ CSS3 to create an interface for the calculator with buttons for digits 0-9, operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication,\
    \ and division, and an equals button for computing the result.\n```\nAll previous tasks are finished and you don't have\
    \ to work on them.\nAfter all the code is finished, a human developer will check if the app works this way - `Visually\
    \ check that the calculator's interface appears correctly with all necessary buttons in a user-friendly layout.`\n\nNow,\
    \ tell me all the code that needs to be written to implement ONLY this task and have it fully working and all commands\
    \ that need to be run to implement this task.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nRemember, I created an empty folder where I will start\
    \ writing files that you tell me and that are needed for this app.\nYou do not need to make any automated tests work.\n\
    \nDO NOT specify commands to create any folders or files, they will be created automatically - just specify the relative\
    \ path to each file that needs to be written.\n\nNever use the port 5000 to run the app, it's reserved."

  content: "To implement task #2, you need to create a front-end user interface for the calculator using Bootstrap, HTML,\
    \ CSS3, and optionally you can use jQuery to make it easier to manipulate the HTML elements.\n\nHere are the steps and\
    \ the code you will need:\n\n1. `public/index.html` - Create the main HTML file with Bootstrap integration and the calculator\
    \ layout:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <title>Calculator</title>\n\
    \  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.0/css/bootstrap.min.css\">\n  <link\
    \ rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n  <div class=\"container\">\n    <h2 class=\"text-center mt-4\"\
    >Calculator</h2>\n    <div id=\"calculator\" class=\"calculator\">\n      <input type=\"text\" id=\"display\" class=\"\
    calculator-screen\" disabled>\n      <div class=\"calculator-keys\">\n        \n        <button type=\"button\" class=\"\
    btn btn-info\" value=\"7\">7</button>\n        <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-info\" value=\"8\">8</button>\n\
    \        <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-info\" value=\"9\">9</button>\n        <button type=\"button\" class=\"\
    btn btn-warning\" value=\"+\">+</button>\n\n        <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-info\" value=\"4\">4</button>\n\
    \        <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-info\" value=\"5\">5</button>\n        <button type=\"button\" class=\"\
    btn btn-info\" value=\"6\">6</button>\n        <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-warning\" value=\"-\">-</button>\n\
    \n        <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-info\" value=\"1\">1</button>\n        <button type=\"button\" class=\"\
    btn btn-info\" value=\"2\">2</button>\n        <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-info\" value=\"3\">3</button>\n\
    \        <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-warning\" value=\"*\">&times;</button>\n\n        <button type=\"button\"\
    \ class=\"btn btn-info\" value=\"0\">0</button>\n        <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-danger\" value=\"C\"\
    >C</button>\n        <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-info\" value=\"=\">=</button>\n        <button type=\"button\"\
    \ class=\"btn btn-warning\" value=\"/\">&divide;</button>\n        \n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <script src=\"\
    https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"script.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\
    \n2. `public/styles.css` - Create CSS file to add styling:\n\n```css\nbody {\n  min-height: 100vh;\n  display: flex;\n\
    \  flex-direction: column;\n  justify-content: center;\n}\n\n.calculator {\n  width: 300px;\n  margin: auto;\n}\n\n.calculator-screen\
    \ {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 80px;\n  text-align: right;\n  padding-right: 20px;\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n  font-size:\
    \ 3rem;\n  border: 2px solid #ccc;\n}\n\n.calculator-keys button {\n  width: 70px;\n  height: 70px;\n  font-size: 2rem;\n\
    \  margin: 5px;\n}\n```\n\n3. `public/script.js` - Add jQuery script to handle button clicks and update the display:\n\
    \n```javascript\n$(document).ready(function() {\n  $('.calculator-keys button').on('click', function() {\n    let buttonValue\
    \ = $(this).val();\n    let displayValue = $('#display').val();\n\n    if (buttonValue === 'C') {\n      $('#display').val('');\n\
    \    } else if (buttonValue === '=') {\n      // This logic will be implemented in another task (Task #4 and #5)\n   \
    \   // For now, just clear the display\n      $('#display').val('');\n    } else {\n      $('#display').val(displayValue\
    \ + buttonValue);\n    }\n  });\n});\n```\n\n4. You will need to modify the `index.js` to serve the static files (HTML,\
    \ CSS, jQuery, and your script) from the \"public\" directory. Here is the code to add:\n\n**/index.js** (additions to\
    \ the existing file)\n```javascript\n// Serve static files from the \"public\" directory\napp.use(express.static('public'));\n\
    ```\n\nNo specific command line commands needed to be run within the context given, as the files are being created and\
    \ written as specified. The server is already set up and running from previous tasks, and these files just need to be\
    \ saved in their respective locations. However, in a real-world scenario, you would typically need to restart the server\
    \ to see the changes or use a tool like nodemon to automatically restart it upon file changes. \n\nYou have now completed\
    \ the task #2. The app will have a basic calculator interface when served, and a reviewer can open the app in a web browser\
    \ to visually check the work as per the user-review goal."

  content: "I need to modify file `\\index.js` that currently looks like this:\n```\nconst express = require('express');\n\

    \  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);\n});\n```\nThis file needs to be modified by these instructions:\n---------------------instructions------------------------------\n\
    Add a line to serve static files from the 'public' directory. Add the following code after your existing Express app setup:\n\
    \n// Serve static files from the \"public\" directory\napp.use(express.static('public'));\n\n----------------------end_of_instructions-----------------------------\n\
    \nI want you to implement the instructions and show me the exact changes (`diff`) in the file `\\index.js`. Reply only\
    \ with the modifications (`diff`) in the following format:\n-----------------------format----------------------------\n\
    CURRENT_CODE:\n```\n(All lines of code from specific code block in the current file that will be replaced by the code\
    \ under NEW_CODE.)\n```\nNEW_CODE:\n```\n(All lines of code that will replace the code under CURRENT_CODE. That includes\
    \ new lines of code and old lines of code that are not being changed but are part of that code block.)\n```\nEND\n------------------------end_of_format---------------------------\n\
    **IMPORTANT**\nHere are rules how to give good response. You have to strictly follow all rules at all times:\n\nRule #1:\n\
    This is most important rule and there must never be reason to break this rule!\nWhen the instructions contain hints such\
    \ as `# .. insert existing code here ...`, it is imperative to interpret and insert the relevant code from the original.\
    \ Never omit any code that belongs in the new block, and never replace any code with comments such as `// the rest of\
    \ the code goes here`, '# existing code from another file', or similar, even if the instructions explicitly request it!\n\
    If the instruction examples reference existing code to be pasted in place, always use the specified code from the previous\
    \ messages in this conversation instead of copying the comment, as illustrated in the following example:\n------------------------example_1---------------------------\n\
    Instructions: \"Rename function increase() { // ... existing code } to function inc() { // ... existing code } and increase\
    \ counter by 10 instead of 1.\"\n------------------------BAD response for example_1:---------------------------\nCURRENT_CODE:\n\
    ```\nfunction increase() {\n   // ... existing code\n}\n```\nNEW_CODE:\n```\nfunction inc() {\n   // ... existing code\n\
    \  return value + 10;\n}\n```\n------------------------GOOD response for example_1:---------------------------\n\nCURRENT_CODE:\n\
    ```\nfunction increase(value) {\n  if (typeof value !== 'number') {\n    throw new Error('Argument must be number');\n\
    \  }\n  return value + 1;\n}\n```\nNEW_CODE:\n```\nfunction inc(value) {\n  if (typeof value !== 'number') {\n    throw\
    \ new Error('Argument must be number');\n  }\n  return value + 10;\n}\nEND\n```\n------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------\n\
    \nRule #2:\nFor each change that needs to be done, you must show exactly one CURRENT_CODE code block and one NEW_CODE\
    \ code block. You can think of this as difference (`diff`) between the current implementation and the new implementation.\n\
    If there are no lines of code that need to be replaced by the NEW_CODE (if the NEW_CODE needs to be added into the CURRENT_CODE),\
    \ show a couple of lines of code in the CURRENT_CODE before the place where NEW_CODE needs to be added.\nHere is an example\
    \ of how to add one line `i--;` in the for loop:\n------------------------example_2---------------------------\nCURRENT_CODE:\n\
    ```\nlet i = 0;\ni++;\nfor (let j = 0; j < 100; j++) {\n```\nNEW_CODE:\n```\nlet i = 0;\ni++;\nfor (let j = 0; j < 100;\
    \ j++) {\n    i--;\n```\nEND\n------------------------end_of_example_2---------------------------\n\nHere's an example\
    \ how to add code to the beginning of the file:\n------------------------example_3---------------------------\nCURRENT_CODE:\n\
    ```\nconst app = express();\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser');\n```\nNEW_CODE:\n```\nconst express = require('express');\n\
    const app = express();\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser');\n```\nEND\n------------------------end_of_example_3---------------------------\n\
    \nRule #3:\nDo not show the entire file under CURRENT_CODE and NEW_CODE but only the lines that need to be replaced. If\
    \ any lines should be left as they are in CURRENT_CODE, do not write them.\n\nRule #4:\nYou must output the CURRENT_CODE\
    \ exactly as it is in the original file, including the indentation from the original code, as it will be used for search-replace,\
    \ and it should only match the original file in ONE place.\nIn the NEW_CODE, remember to follow the same coding style\
    \ that is used in the rest of the file. Pay special attention to the indentation of the new code and make sure to include\
    \ all the required old and new code, without omitting anything.\nPay very close attention to parenthesis and make sure\
    \ that when CURRENT_CODE is replaced with NEW_CODE there are no extra parenthesis or any parenthesis missing.\n"
response: 'CURRENT_CODE:

  ```

  const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000; // Choose a port to listen on, ensure it''s not port 5000
