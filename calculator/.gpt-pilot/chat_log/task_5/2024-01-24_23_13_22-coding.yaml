  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

    \ App\n\nThis project is a web-based calculator that allows users to perform the four basic arithmetic operations: addition,\
    \ subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is built using Node.js and Express for the backend, with a frontend using\
    \ Bootstrap for styling, and jQuery for interactivity.\n\n## Features\n\n- Simple and intuitive UI\n- Perform basic mathematics\
    \ operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division\n- Responsive design for various screen sizes\n\n## Technologies\
    \ Used\n\n- Node.js\n- Express\n- Bootstrap\n- HTML\n- CSS3\n- jQuery\n\n## Project Structure\n\n- `package.json`: Defines\
    \ npm dependencies and scripts.\n- `index.js`: Main server file that sets up the Express server.\n- `public/index.html`:\
    \ Entry point for the frontend, contains the markup for the calculator.\n- `public/script.js`: Handles the calculator's\
    \ logic and UI interactions.\n- `public/styles.css`: Contains styles for the calculator's interface.\n\n## Setup\n\n1.\
    \ Clone the repository\n2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.\n3. Start the server with `node index.js`.\n\
    4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to use the calculator.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under\
    \ the ISC license.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions to the Calculator app are welcome. Please ensure that your code\
    \ adheres to the existing style and has appropriate test coverage. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss\
    \ what you would like to change.\n\nPlease make sure to update tests as appropriate.\n```\n\n\n\n\nWe've broken the development\
    \ of this app down to these tasks:\n```\n1. Initialize a Node.js project with Express framework and set up an Express\
    \ server to run on a pre-specified port. Include a basic root route that sends a response indicating the server is live.\n\
    \n2. Implement the front end using Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS3 to create an interface for the calculator with buttons for\
    \ digits 0-9, operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and an equals button for computing the\
    \ result.\n\n3. Create jQuery scripts enabling the calculator's buttons to update a display field on the user interface\
    \ with the user's input, including numbers and selected operations.\n\n4. Develop the logic for the calculator's backend\
    \ in Node.js to handle HTTP POST requests with calculations to perform and return the result.\n\n5. Integrate the frontend\
    \ with the backend such that clicking the equals button on the UI sends a request to the backend, calculates the result,\
    \ and displays the result on the UI.\n\n```\n\nYou are currently working on task #5 with the following description:\n\
    ```\nIntegrate the frontend with the backend such that clicking the equals button on the UI sends a request to the backend,\
    \ calculates the result, and displays the result on the UI.\n```\nAll previous tasks are finished and you don't have to\
    \ work on them.\nAfter all the code is finished, a human developer will check if the app works this way - `Perform several\
    \ calculations using the calculator UI, ensuring that after pressing the equals button, the UI reflects the correct result\
    \ of the computation.`\n\nNow, tell me all the code that needs to be written to implement ONLY this task and have it fully\
    \ working and all commands that need to be run to implement this task.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nRemember, I created an empty\
    \ folder where I will start writing files that you tell me and that are needed for this app.\nYou do not need to make\
    \ any automated tests work.\n\nDO NOT specify commands to create any folders or files, they will be created automatically\
    \ - just specify the relative path to each file that needs to be written.\n\nNever use the port 5000 to run the app, it's\
    \ reserved."

  content: "To complete task #5, the code for integrating the frontend with the backend has largely been implemented in the\
    \ provided files. You will verify that the existing code in the `public/script.js` allows the frontend to send the calculation\
    \ request to the backend, and that the backend, as defined in `index.js`, processes the request and sends back the result.\
    \ \n\nThe provided `index.js` and `public/script.js` files seem correctly set up for this functionality. However, you\
    \ should replace the use of `eval()` in the backend with a safer alternative due to security concerns. The `mathjs` library\
    \ is included in the dependencies, so we should use it instead.\n\nReplace the corresponding part in `/index.js` with\
    \ the following code to use `mathjs` instead of `eval()`:\n\n```javascript\nconst math = require('mathjs');\n\n// ...\n\
    \napp.post('/calculate', (req, res) => {\n  const { expression } = req.body;\n  try {\n    const result = math.evaluate(expression);\n\
    \    res.send({ result: result.toString() });\n  } catch (error) {\n    res.status(500).send({ error: 'Error evaluating\
    \ the expression' });\n  }\n});\n```\n\nAdd `const math = require('mathjs');` at the beginning of `index.js`.\n\nBefore\
    \ testing this integration, ensure that your Node.js environment is set up with all the required dependencies by running:\n\
    \n```sh\nnpm install\n```\n\nOnce done, you can start the Express server with:\n\n```sh\nnode index.js\n```\n\nOpen `http://localhost:3000`\
    \ in your browser and try performing some calculations using the UI to confirm everything is working as expected. When\
    \ you press the equals button \"=\", the request should be sent to the backend, processed, and the correct result should\
    \ be displayed in the UI.\n\nSince `/index.js` and `public/script.js` already contain the necessary code to send the request,\
    \ perform the calculation, and display the response on the UI, no further code changes are needed for task #5, other than\
    \ the security-related update mentioned above."
