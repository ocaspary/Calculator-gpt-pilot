  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.
- role: user
  content: 'You are working on a App called "calculator" and you need to write code for the entire app based on the tasks
    that the tech lead gives you. So that you understand better what you''re working on, you''re given other specs for "calculator"
    as well.


    Here is a high level description of "calculator":

    ```

    create a calculator that can do main 4 math functions

    ```



    Here are the technologies that you need to use for this project:

    ```


    - Node.js


    - Express


    - Bootstrap


    - HTML


    - CSS3


    - jQuery


    ```






    We''ve broken the development of this app down to these tasks:

    ```

    1. Initialize a Node.js project with Express framework and set up an Express server to run on a pre-specified port. Include
    a basic root route that sends a response indicating the server is live.


    2. Implement the front end using Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS3 to create an interface for the calculator with buttons for
    digits 0-9, operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and an equals button for computing the
    result.


    3. Create jQuery scripts enabling the calculator''s buttons to update a display field on the user interface with the user''s
    input, including numbers and selected operations.


    4. Develop the logic for the calculator''s backend in Node.js to handle HTTP POST requests with calculations to perform
    and return the result.


    5. Integrate the frontend with the backend such that clicking the equals button on the UI sends a request to the backend,
    calculates the result, and displays the result on the UI.


    ```


    You are currently working on task #1 with the following description:

    ```

    Initialize a Node.js project with Express framework and set up an Express server to run on a pre-specified port. Include
    a basic root route that sends a response indicating the server is live.

    ```


    After all the code is finished, a human developer will check if the app works this way - `Confirm that accessing the root
    URL of the application in a web browser shows a message indicating the server is operational.`


    Now, tell me all the code that needs to be written to implement ONLY this task and have it fully working and all commands
    that need to be run to implement this task.


    **IMPORTANT**

    Remember, I created an empty folder where I will start writing files that you tell me and that are needed for this app.

    You do not need to make any automated tests work.


    DO NOT specify commands to create any folders or files, they will be created automatically - just specify the relative
    path to each file that needs to be written.


    Never use the port 5000 to run the app, it''s reserved.'
- role: assistant
  content: "To complete task #1, here are the steps that you need to follow:\n\nFirst, you need to initialize a new Node.js\
    \ project and install Express. Open your terminal in your project directory and run the following commands:\n\n```sh\n\
    npm init -y                 # initializes a new Node.js project\nnpm install express --save  # installs the Express framework\n\
    ```\n\nNow you need to set up your Express server. Create a new file for your server code:\n\n```\n./index.js\n```\n\n\
    In `index.js`, write the following code:\n\n```javascript\n// index.js\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app\
    \ = express();\nconst PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000; // Choose a port to listen on, ensure it's not port 5000\n\napp.get('/',\
    \ (req, res) => {\n  res.send('Calculator App server is operational');\n});\n\napp.listen(PORT, () => {\n  console.log(`Server\
    \ running on port ${PORT}`);\n});\n```\n\nThis code will do the following:\n\n- Import the express module\n- Create an\
    \ instance of an Express application\n- Set a port for the server to listen on (excluding port 5000 as per your instruction)\n\
    - Define a root route (`'/'`) that responds with a message indicating the server is live\n- Start the server and have\
    \ it listen on the specified port\n\nWith these changes, the main task of setting up a basic Express server that responds\
    \ on the root route is complete. To run the server, use this command in the terminal:\n\n```sh\nnode index.js\n```\n\n\
    After running this command, the server will be live, and you can access it in a web browser by navigating to `http://localhost:3000`\
    \ or whatever port you chose (as long as it's not port 5000). You should see the message \"Calculator App server is operational\"\
    \ indicating that the server is running correctly.\n\nThat's it for task #1! Remember, the PORT is set to be determined\
    \ by the environment or default to 3000, which allows for flexibility in deployment environments."

  content: "Ok, now, take your previous message that starts with `To complete task #1, here` and ends with `for flexibility\
    \ in deployment environments.` and convert it to a list of actionable steps that will be executed by a machine. Analyze\

    \ if the existing file is smaller than 20 lines or if many lines need to be changed\n* `modify_file` - update ONE existing\
    \ file; use this if the existing file is larger than 20 lines and only a few lines need to be updated\n\nIf the step is\
