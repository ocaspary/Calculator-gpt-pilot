    products) for Apps that can be developed as fast as possible by using as many ready-made technologies as possible.

  content: 'You are working in a software development agency and a project manager approached you telling you that you''re
    assigned to work on a new project. You  are working on a App called "calculator" and you need to create specifications
    on what technologies should be used in this project.


    Here is a high level description of "calculator":

    ```

    create a calculator that can do main 4 math functions

    ```




    Now, based on the projects details, think step by step and list the names of the technologies that will be used by your
    development team to create the app "calculator".

    Do not give any subjective thoughts or options, give exact technologies, for example:

    Instead of ["D3.js or other suitable charting library", "axios or other http client library"] answer with ["D3.js", "axios"].


    You do not need to list any technologies related to automated tests (like Jest, Cypress, Mocha, Selenium, etc) or  any
    technologies related to deployment (like Heroku).


    **Project Technology Guidelines**

    Relevance: Only include technologies that are essential and will be actively used in the project. Avoid mentioning any
    technologies that are not required. For example, don''t suggest MongoDB if database is not needed for project.

    Compatibility: Ensure that the listed technologies are compatible with each other. Exclude any technologies that cannot
    be integrated or used in conjunction with others. For example, Pandas (Python library) and Node.js can''t be used together.
    Another example is MongoDB (NoSQL database) and MySQL (SQL database) shouldn''t be used together unless that is specified
    in project description.

    Technology Preferences: In scenarios where multiple technology options are available for a specific project component,
    prioritize the following preferred technologies:

    - Node.js,

    - MongoDB,

    - PeeWee,

    - Bootstrap,

    - HTML,

    - CSS3,

    - cronjob,

    - Socket.io


    **IMPORTANT**

    Do not use, create or suggest any microservices. Create strictly monolithic application even if in some prompts I might
    suggest microservices might be better or more desired solution. Do your best to find a solution to any requirement without
    using microservices.'
