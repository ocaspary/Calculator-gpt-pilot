  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "You are working on a App called \"calculator\" and you need to write code for the entire app based on the tasks\
    \ that the tech lead gives you. So that you understand better what you're working on, you're given other specs for \"\

    \ the development of this app down to these tasks:\n```\n1. Initialize a Node.js project with Express framework and set\
    \ up an Express server to run on a pre-specified port. Include a basic root route that sends a response indicating the\
    \ server is live.\n\n2. Implement the front end using Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS3 to create an interface for the calculator\
    \ with buttons for digits 0-9, operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and an equals button\
    \ for computing the result.\n\n3. Create jQuery scripts enabling the calculator's buttons to update a display field on\
    \ the user interface with the user's input, including numbers and selected operations.\n\n4. Develop the logic for the\
    \ calculator's backend in Node.js to handle HTTP POST requests with calculations to perform and return the result.\n\n\
    5. Integrate the frontend with the backend such that clicking the equals button on the UI sends a request to the backend,\
    \ calculates the result, and displays the result on the UI.\n\n```\n\nYou are currently working on task #3 with the following\
    \ description:\n```\nCreate jQuery scripts enabling the calculator's buttons to update a display field on the user interface\
    \ with the user's input, including numbers and selected operations.\n```\nAll previous tasks are finished and you don't\
    \ have to work on them.\nAfter all the code is finished, a human developer will check if the app works this way - `Physically\
    \ test the buttons on the calculator to ensure each one updates the display field correctly with the input value.`\n\n\
    Now, tell me all the code that needs to be written to implement ONLY this task and have it fully working and all commands\
    \ that need to be run to implement this task.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nRemember, I created an empty folder where I will start\
    \ writing files that you tell me and that are needed for this app.\nYou do not need to make any automated tests work.\n\
    \nDO NOT specify commands to create any folders or files, they will be created automatically - just specify the relative\
    \ path to each file that needs to be written.\n\nNever use the port 5000 to run the app, it's reserved."
response: "To implement task #3, you need to update the `public/script.js` file so that it properly updates the display field\
  \ when a button is clicked. The operations buttons (+, -, *, /) and numbers (0-9) will be concatenated onto the display\
  \ field's value as they're pressed. The 'C' button will clear the display.\n\nHere is the updated code for `public/script.js`:\n\
  \n```javascript\n$(document).ready(function() {\n  $('.calculator-keys button').on('click', function() {\n    let buttonValue\
  \ = $(this).val();\n    let displayValue = $('#display').val();\n\n    if (buttonValue === 'C') {\n      $('#display').val('');\n\
  \    } else {\n      $('#display').val(displayValue + buttonValue);\n    }\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThis script will:\n\n1. Wait\
  \ for the HTML document to be fully loaded and ready.\n2. Add a click event listener to all button elements inside the `.calculator-keys`\
  \ div.\n3. Define a function that is called when a button is clicked. \n4. Check if the `C` button is clicked, in which\
  \ case it will clear the display by setting its value to an empty string.\n5. If any other button is clicked (numbers or\
  \ operators), it will append its value to the display value.\n\nNo commands need to be run to implement this task, as the\
  \ server is already set up from the previous tasks, and the frontend code is served statically to the client by the Express\
  \ app. \n\nWhen you save this file and visit the application in the browser, clicking the buttons should update the display\
  \ field with user input as described. Remember to refresh the webpage if it's already open. \n\nLastly, ensure that Node.js\
  \ with Express is still running the app (`node index.js` from the root directory, not from the `public` directory) so that\
  \ the updated `script.js` file is served correctly."
